# House-Price-Prediction-XGBoost
End-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict house prices using XGBoost and Scikit-learn Pipelines.

## Project Overview
This project implements a robust machine learning pipeline to predict residential house prices. It features an automated data preprocessing workflow and a high-performance regression model.

## Key Features
- **Advanced Preprocessing:** Automated handling of numerical and categorical data using Scikit-learn `ColumnTransformer`.
- **Outlier Handling:** Implemented Winsorization to manage extreme data points.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracted total square footage to improve model accuracy.
- **Model:** Optimized **XGBoost Regressor** with fine-tuned hyperparameters.
- **Pipeline Architecture:** Used `Pipeline` to ensure clean, reproducible code and prevent data leakage.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
